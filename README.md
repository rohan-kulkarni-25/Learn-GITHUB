## Why To Contribute Here After Learning From Experts ?
1. As you have learnt from the much experienced persons than me it's obvious you will be like "why should I waste time contributing here !!"
2. And it's pretty right I totally agree that 
3. But just listen to me once and then think, decision is  yours !!
4. I have created this repo only for new learner who are doing there first PR on GitHub
5. As doing changes in this repo will help them to gain confidence for making change in codebase of other open source projects.
6. And in short  they will get familiar with the flow of GitHub
7. So its my kind request please do a PR on this repo by following the steps given below !!

## I have hosted a GitHub Page of this REPO you can see it by clicking the link <br>https://rohank2502.github.io/Learn-GITHUB/
1. As you make suggested changes in code your name with remarks can also get added !! 
2. Just to make it Intresting.

## Steps To be Followed ( Expecting you have  watched suggested videos )
1. Open this repo from the link provided to you or from my profile 
2. As you see my name and then Name of repo it means that this project is mine ( In simple language )
3. As this project is mine you  cannot make changes in it for this you have to Fork and Clone this repo in your own system 
4. There is fork option on Top right side of page click on that. ( Project is Forked )
5. Then you will see green color code button click on that,you will see a link, this link is used to clone the project in your local system with the help of gitbash
6. I am providing the link here just copy the statement in brackets and paste it in git bash. Sometimes `ctrl+V` don't work there  so we can use right click of mouse.
7. (git clone https://github.com/rohank2502/Learn-GITHUB.git) This will clone the repo and when you open your GitHub now in repositories section you will see this repo with your name 
8. It means that its your code and you can make changes in it !!
9. Then you have to open the index.html file 
10. From this file you don't need to understand any code it's just an example of codebase.
11. You have to click the edit (pencil) option and 
12. You have to scroll down and you will get the below code 
13. 
        <h3>No:-1</h3>
        <h3>Name:-Rohan Kulkarni</h3> 
        <h3>Remark:-Yes !! I learnerd to Fork a Repo, Clone a Repo, Commit Changes in code and to make a PR !!</h3>
 13. You just have to copy the code and paste it below as the serial is going on.
 14. You have to update the data as index number which is going on and then your name and we can keep the same remark or you can also write your own !!
 15. This is just to help you learn how to make changes in code 
 16. Then you have to write what you have changed in this code For eg:- Updated Index.html ( Or any realatable )
 17. Then you have to click on commit changes 
 18. This will make changes in your codebase but as i am the owner of projects they should be reflected in mine to 
 19. For this you have to create a pull request.
 20. You have to go to Pull request section and then click on new pull request. 
 21. And Tell about changes u did and something link that 
 22. Then after creating sucessfull request it will be checked by me and then merged
 23. Like this you will be able to Learn about GIT-Basic
