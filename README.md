4. I have created this repo only for new learner who are doing there first PR on GIT-HUB 
5. As doing changes in this repo will help them to gain confidance for making change in codebase of the projects.
6. And in short  they will get familiar with the  flow of GIT-HUB
7. So its my kind request please do a PR on this repo by following the steps given below !!

## I have hosted a Git-Hub Page of this REPO you can see it by clicking the link <br>https://rohank2502.github.io/Learn-GITHUB/

2. Just to make it Intresting.

## Steps To be Followed ( Expecting you have  watched suggested videos )
1. Open this repo from the link provided to you or from my profile 
2. As you see my name and then Name of repo it means that this project is mine ( In simple language )
3. As this project is mine you  cannot make changes in it for this you have to Fork and Clone this project in your own system 
4. There is fork option on Top right side of page click on that. ( Your Project is Forked )
5. Then you will see green color code button click on that,you will see a link this link is used to clone our project in your local system with the help of gitbash
6. I am providing the link her just copy the statement in brackets and paste it in git bash. Sometimes ctrl + V dont work there  so we can use right click of mouse.
7. ( git clone https://github.com/rohank2502/Learn-GITHUB.git ) This will clone you repo and when you open your github now in repo you will see this repo with you name 
8. It means that its you code and you can make changes in it !!
9. Then you have  to open the index.html file 
10.From this file you dont need to understand any code it just an example of codebase
11.You have to click the eidt (pencil) option and 
12.You have  to scroll down and you will get the below code 
13. 
        <h3>No:-1</h3>
        <h3>Name:-Rohan Kulkarni</h3> 
        <h3>Remark:-Yes !! I learnerd to Fork a Repo,Clone a Repo,Commit Changes in code and to make a PR !!</h3>
 13. You just have to copy the code and paste it below as the serial is going on.
 14. You have to update the data as index number which is going on and then you name and we can keep the same remark or you can also write your own !!
 15. This is just to help you learn how to make changes in code 
 16. Then you have to write what you have changed in this code For eg:- Updated Index.html ( Or any realatable )
 17. Then you have to click on commit changes 
 18. This will make changes in your codebase but as i am the owner of projects they should be reflected in mine to 
 19. For this you have to create a pull request.
 20. You have to go to Pull request section and then click on new pull request. 
 21. And Tell about changes u did and something link that 
 22. Then after creating sucessfull request it will be checked by me and then merged
